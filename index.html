        <h1>Ashai Ramsunder, MSc</h1>
        <p><em>Senior Developer</em> at <strong>Massmart</strong> <em>Powered by Walmart</em></p>
        <p>
          Ashai is in the possession of a <strong>Masters Degree</strong> in
          <em>Applied Mathematics</em> which has been granted <em>Cum Laude</em> and various papers
          have been submitted for publication as a result. Ashai’s area of expertise
          is <strong>numerical analysis</strong> and <strong>signal processing</strong>
          specifically relating to that of transformation theory and differential equations.
       </p>
       <p>
         At the beginning of <em>January 2016</em>, Ashai made the decision to join the
         <strong>Financial Services Advisory</strong> division at <em>Deloitte</em>,
         and has worked on stress testing models for the first time in his career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Ashai comes from a primary background of academia, working in a
        consulting environment has allowed him to gain experience and knowledge
        on developing central models within the banking industry.
        Apart from stress testing, Ashai has also been involved in a
        materiality and complexity assessment of the banks portfolios.
        He has designed a high level overview modelling methodology for the
        banking portfolios deemed material and is planning to carry this design forward.
        Ashai has also developed a keen interest in the treasury unit of the bank
        where he has had the opportunity to work for group treasury in assisting
        with the daily implementation and processes of the LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio)
        calculation and identifying key differences between the daily and monthly LCR processes.
        The insightful experience of working on multiple projects has allowed Ashai to gain exposure
        to several financial risk types such as Credit Risk, Market Risk, Liquidity Risk and Valuations.
        He has had opportunities to develop his technical skills and programming languages
        which include MATLAB, SAS, SPSS, Mathematica, R, Python, VBA, HTML 5, CSS 3 and most recently Javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
        After gaining valuable experience and knowledge at Deloitte,
        Ashai decided to take on a new challenge at one of South Africas top four banks
        where he acquired the position of <strong>Model Risk Auditor</strong>
        for the <strong>Internal Audit division</strong>.
        Ashai has decided, after much deliberation and experience,
        that Application Development and Business Intelligence is the appropriate space to align with his strengths and
        as such after a short stint as a <strong>Model Risk Auditor</strong>,
        Ashai has taken on the role as a Senior Developer / Senior Business Intelligence Analyst at
        <strong>Massmart</strong> <em>Powered by Walmart</em>.</p>
        Ashai is currently the <strong>lead developer </strong> in the team where he is allowed to gain valuable
        experience in the retail industry by applying mathematical, statistical and full stack application development
        knowledge to solve complex problems relating to <strong>Data Science</strong>
        and <strong>Business Intelligence</strong>.
